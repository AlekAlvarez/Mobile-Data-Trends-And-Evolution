CVE-2022-0018
An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE-2022-1343
The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL "ocsp" application. When verifying an ocsp response with the "-no_cert_checks" option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).

This could have been used by an attacker to send an email message with the attacker's digital signature, that was shown with an arbitrary sender email address chosen by the attacker. If the sender name started with a false email address, followed by many Braille space characters, the attacker's email address was not visible. Because Thunderbird compared the invisible sender address with the signature's email address, if the signing key or certificate was accepted by Thunderbird, the email was shown as having a valid digital signature.

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Discourse groups can be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as the group members. By default, a newly created group has its visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 2.7.13 and 2.8.0.beta11 where the group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with the right search option. This issue is patched in `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11 versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.

Wagtail is a Django based content management system focused on flexibility and user experience. When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent, they are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new comment replies on pages they have not have editing access to, as long as they have left a comment or reply somewhere on the site. A patched version has been released as Wagtail 2.15.2, which restores the intended behaviour - to send notifications for new replies to the participants in the active thread only (editing permissions are not considered). New comments can be disabled by setting `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED = False` in the Django settings file.

CVE-2022-22208
A Use After Free vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rdp) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS). When a BGP session flap happens, a Use After Free of a memory location that was assigned to another object can occur, which will lead to an rpd crash. This is a race condition that is outside of the attacker's control and cannot be deterministically exploited. Continued flapping of BGP sessions can create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S11; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 version 19.2R1 and later versions; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S6; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S1, 21.2R3.

CVE-2022-22215
A Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in plugable authentication module (PAM) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). It is possible that after the termination of a gRPC connection the respective/var/run/<pid>.env file is not getting deleted which if occurring repeatedly can cause inode exhaustion. Inode exhaustion can present itself in two different ways: 1. The following log message can be observed: host kernel: pid <pid> (<process>), uid <uid> inumber <number> on /.mount/var: out of inodes which by itself is a clear indication. 2. The following log message can be observed: host <process>[<pid>]: ... : No space left on device which is not deterministic and just a representation of a write error which could have several reasons. So the following check needs to be done: user@host> show system storage no-forwarding Filesystem Size Used Avail Capacity Mounted on /dev/ada1p1 475M 300M 137M 69% /.mount/var which indicates that the write error is not actually due to a lack of disk space. If either 1. or 2. has been confirmed, then the output of: user@host> file list /var/run/*.env | count need to be checked and if it indicates a high (>10000) number of files the system has been affected by this issue. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S7; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S4; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronizing files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. The communication between GitOps Run and the local S3 bucket is not encrypted. This allows privileged users or process to tap the local traffic to gain information permitting access to the s3 bucket. From that point, it would be possible to alter the bucket content, resulting in changes in the Kubernetes cluster's resources. There are no known workaround(s) for this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed by commits ce2bbff and babd915. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022.

Wire-ios is a messaging application using the wire protocol on apple's ios platform. In versions prior to 3.95 malformed resource identifiers may render the iOS Wire Client completely unusable by causing it to repeatedly crash on launch. These malformed resource identifiers can be generated and sent between Wire users. The root cause lies in [wireapp/wire-ios-transport](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport), where code responsible for removing sensible tokens before logging may fail and lead to a crash (Swift exception) of the application. This causes undesirable behavior, however the (greater) Wire system is still functional. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key pair by the telnetd_startup service allows an attacker on the local area network to obtain a root shell on the device over telnet. The builds of telnetd_startup included in the version 22.5.9.163 of the K2 firmware, and version 32.1.15.93 of the K3C firmware (possibly amongst many other releases) included both the private and public RSA keys. The remaining versions cited here redacted the private key, but left the public key unchanged. An attacker in possession of the leaked private key may, through a scripted exchange of UDP packets, instruct telnetd_startup to spawn an unauthenticated telnet shell as root, by means of which they can then obtain complete control of the device. A consequence of the limited availablility of firmware images for testing is that models and versions not listed here may share this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-26305
An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed where determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author was done by only matching the serial number and issuer string of the used certificate with that of a trusted certificate. This is not sufficient to verify that the macro was actually signed with the certificate. An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.

This scheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen. Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference has a race condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and creates a window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping before writeability is prohibited.

It was discovered that the sls-logging was not verifying hostnames in TLS certificates due to a misuse of the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory API. A malicious attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow them to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the affected service. In the case of AtlasDB, the vulnerability was mitigated by other network controls such as two-way TLS when deployed as part of a Palantir platform. Palantir still recommends upgrading to a non-vulnerable version out of an abundance of caution.

CVE-2022-29186
Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools and a WebAPI. Rundeck community and rundeck-enterprise docker images contained a pre-generated SSH keypair. If the id_rsa.pub public key of the keypair was copied to authorized_keys files on remote host, those hosts would allow access to anyone with the exposed private credentials. This misconfiguration only impacts Rundeck Docker instances of PagerDuty® Process Automation On Prem (formerly Rundeck) version 4.0 and earlier, not Debian, RPM or .WAR. Additionally, the id_rsa.pub file would have to be copied from the Docker image filesystem contents without overwriting it and used to configure SSH access on a host. A patch on Rundeck's `main` branch has removed the pre-generated SSH key pair, but it does not remove exposed keys that have been configured. To patch, users must run a script on hosts in their environment to search for exposed keys and rotate them. Two workarounds are available: Do not use any pre-existing public key file from the rundeck docker images to allow SSH access by adding it to authorized_keys files and, if you have copied the public key file included in the docker image, remove it from any authorized_keys files.

The Trend Controls IC protocol through 2022-05-06 allows Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. According to FSCT-2022-0050, there is a Trend Controls Inter-Controller (IC) protocol cleartext transmission of credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: Inter-Controller (IC) protocol (57612/UDP). The potential impact is: Compromise of credentials. Several Trend Controls building automation controllers utilize the Inter-Controller (IC) protocol in for information exchange and automation purposes. This protocol offers authentication in the form of a 4-digit PIN in order to protect access to sensitive operations like strategy uploads and downloads as well as optional 0-30 character username and password protection for web page access protection. Both the PIN and usernames and passwords are transmitted in cleartext, allowing an attacker with passive interception capabilities to obtain these credentials. Credentials are transmitted in cleartext. An attacker who obtains Trend IC credentials can carry out sensitive engineering actions such as manipulating controller strategy or configuration settings. If the credentials in question are (re)used for other applications, their compromise could potentially facilitate lateral movement.

CVE-2022-31069
NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.4.0 and prior to 2.2.11, 2.3.6, and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to an improper certificate validation bug which could cause Argo CD to trust a malicious (or otherwise untrustworthy) OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.4.5, 2.3.6, and 2.2.11. There are no complete workarounds, but a partial workaround is available. Those who use an external OIDC provider (not the bundled Dex instance), can mitigate the issue by setting the `oidc.config.rootCA` field in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. This mitigation only forces certificate validation when the API server handles login flows. It does not force certificate verification when verifying tokens on API calls.

CVE-2022-33681
Delayed TLS hostname verification in the Pulsar Java Client and the Pulsar Proxy make each client vulnerable to a man in the middle attack. Connections from the Pulsar Java Client to the Pulsar Broker/Proxy and connections from the Pulsar Proxy to the Pulsar Broker are vulnerable. Authentication data is sent before verifying the server’s TLS certificate matches the hostname, which means authentication data could be exposed to an attacker. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate for an unrelated host. Because the client sends authentication data before performing hostname verification, an attacker could gain access to the client’s authentication data. The client eventually closes the connection when it verifies the hostname and identifies the targeted hostname does not match a hostname on the certificate. Because the client eventually closes the connection, the value of the intercepted authentication data depends on the authentication method used by the client. Token based authentication and username/password authentication methods are vulnerable because the authentication data can be used to impersonate the client in a separate session. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Java Client versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.

The vulnerability is for both the pulsar+ssl protocol and HTTPS. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate for an unrelated host. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker, Proxy, and WebSocket Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.

CVE-2022-33684
The Apache Pulsar C++ Client does not verify peer TLS certificates when making HTTPS calls for the OAuth2.0 Client Credential Flow, even when tlsAllowInsecureConnection is disabled via configuration. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a man in the middle attack and intercept and/or modify the GET request that is sent to the ClientCredentialFlow 'issuer url'. The intercepted credentials can be used to acquire authentication data from the OAuth2.0 server to then authenticate with an Apache Pulsar cluster. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack. The Apache Pulsar Python Client wraps the C++ client, so it is also vulnerable in the same way. This issue affects Apache Pulsar C++ Client and Python Client versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0 to 2.10.1; 2.6.4 and earlier. Any users running affected versions of the C++ Client or the Python Client should rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials, including client_id and client_secret. 2.7 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.7.5 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. 2.8 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.8.4 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. 2.9 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.9.3 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. 2.10 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.10.2 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. 3.0 C++ users are unaffected and 3.0 Python Client users will be unaffected when it is released. Any users running the C++ and Python Client for 2.6 or less should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.

Tabit - giftcard stealth. Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described APIs, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a 'tiny URL' in tabits domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 character long string containing numbers, lower and upper case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information.

During the ACME enrollment process, an order is submitted containing an identifier for one or multiple dnsNames. These are validated properly in the ACME challenge. However, if the validation passes, a non-compliant client can include additional dnsNames the CSR sent to the finalize endpoint, resulting in EJBCA issuing a certificate including the identifiers that were not validated. This occurs even if the certificate profile is configured to not allow a DN override by the CSR.

SFTPGo is configurable SFTP server with optional HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV support. SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as a secondary authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP. In SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication. An attacker who knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after it is enabled on the account at a later time. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor authentication and are deleted after disabling it.

CVE-2022-3913
Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions 6.6.82 through 6.6.177 fail to validate the certificate of the update server when downloading updates. This failure could allow an attacker in a privileged position on the network to provide their own HTTPS endpoint, or intercept communications to the legitimate endpoint. The attacker would need some pre-existing access to at least one node on the network path between the Rapid7-controlled update server and the Nexpose/InsightVM application, and the ability to either spoof the update server's FQDN or redirect legitimate traffic to the attacker's server in order to exploit this vulnerability. Note that even in this scenario, an attacker could not normally replace an update package with a malicious package, since the update process validates a separate, code-signing certificate, distinct from the HTTPS certificate used for communication. This issue was resolved on February 1, 2023 in update 6.6.178 of Nexpose and InsightVM.

This attack is possible due to the key forwarding strategy implemented in the matrix-android-sdk2 that is too permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2. The matrix-android-sdk2 will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable key forwarding in their forks using `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`.

CVE-2022-39248
matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key, spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.

Actors with access to the audit log can exploit this flaw to gain access to valid API keys. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.6.0. Instead of logging the entire API key, only the last 4 characters of the key will be logged. It is strongly recommended to check historic logs for occurrences of this behavior, and re-generating API keys in case of leakage.

Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded, which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance, Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is, for example, posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported and always fails, 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue. As a workaround, turn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file.

CVE-2022-43551
A vulnerability exists in curl <7.87.0 HSTS check that could be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`. Then in a subsequent request, it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it would store the info IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded.

Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In affected versions there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing TLS connections. A router configured with a not well-formatted TLSOption is exposed with an empty TLSOption. For instance, a route secured using an mTLS connection set with a wrong CA file is exposed without verifying the client certificates. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.9.6. Users unable to upgrade should check their logs to detect the error messages and fix your TLS options.

CVE-2022-46155
Airtable.js is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users’ environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user’s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.

CVE-2022-48689
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status

We got a recent syzbot report [1] showing a possible misuse
of pfmemalloc page status in TCP zerocopy paths.

Indeed, for pages coming from user space or other layers,
using page_is_pfmemalloc() is moot, and possibly could give
false positives.

There has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,
but not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,
removing cpu cycles.

Note to stable teams :

You need to backport 84ce071e38a6 ("net: introduce
__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc") as a prereq.

Race is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4
("mm: add a signature in struct page") because page_is_pfmemalloc()
is now using low order bit from page->lru.next, which can change
more often than page->index.

Low order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchor
in LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.

Backporting to older kernel versions seems not necessary.

CVE-2022-48759
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rpmsg: char: Fix race between the release of rpmsg_ctrldev and cdev

struct rpmsg_ctrldev contains a struct cdev. The current code frees
the rpmsg_ctrldev struct in rpmsg_ctrldev_release_device(), but the
cdev is a managed object, therefore its release is not predictable
and the rpmsg_ctrldev could be freed before the cdev is entirely
released, as in the backtrace below.

CVE-2022-48784
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction

My previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where
the exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced
below) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already
runs while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some
interfaces as nl_owner_dead.

The race happens because we have two loops here - first we
dev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If we
also have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)
then we can find one during the first iteration, close it,
and go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try
to destroy also the one we didn't close yet.

Fix this by only iterating once.

CVE-2022-48842
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Fix race condition during interface enslave

Commit 5dbbbd01cbba83 ("ice: Avoid RTNL lock when re-creating
auxiliary device") changes a process of re-creation of aux device
so ice_plug_aux_dev() is called from ice_service_task() context.
This unfortunately opens a race window that can result in dead-lock
when interface has left LAG and immediately enters LAG again.

Reproducer:
```
#!/bin/sh

ip link add lag0 type bond mode 1 miimon 100
ip link set lag0

for n in {1..10}; do
        echo Cycle: $n
        ip link set ens7f0 master lag0
        sleep 1
        ip link set ens7f0 nomaster
done

2. Command 'ip link ... set master...' calls ice's notifier under

- The bit is checked in ice_clear_rdma_cap() and only if it is not set

net/mlx5: Fix a race on command flush flow

Fix a refcount use after free warning due to a race on command entry.
Such race occurs when one of the commands releases its last refcount and
frees its index and entry while another process running command flush
flow takes refcount to this command entry. The process which handles
commands flush may see this command as needed to be flushed if the other
process released its refcount but didn't release the index yet. Fix it
by adding the needed spin lock.

CVE-2022-48898
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: do not complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx() if irq is not for aux transfer

There are 3 possible interrupt sources are handled by DP controller,
HPDstatus, Controller state changes and Aux read/write transaction.
At every irq, DP controller have to check isr status of every interrupt
sources and service the interrupt if its isr status bits shows interrupts
are pending. There is potential race condition may happen at current aux
isr handler implementation since it is always complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx()
even irq is not for aux read or write transaction. This may cause aux read
transaction return premature if host aux data read is in the middle of
waiting for sink to complete transferring data to host while irq happen.
This will cause host's receiving buffer contains unexpected data. This
patch fixes this problem by checking aux isr and return immediately at
aux isr handler if there are no any isr status bits set.

Current there is a bug report regrading eDP edid corruption happen during
system booting up. After lengthy debugging to found that VIDEO_READY
interrupt was continuously firing during system booting up which cause
dp_aux_isr() to complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx() prematurely to retrieve data
from aux hardware buffer which is not yet contains complete data transfer
from sink. This cause edid corruption.

Follows are the signature at kernel logs when problem happen,
EDID has corrupt header

CVE-2022-48921
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entity

Syzbot found a GPF in reweight_entity. This has been bisected to
commit 4ef0c5c6b5ba ("kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid
sched_task_group")

There is a race between sched_post_fork() and setpriority(PRIO_PGRP)
within a thread group that causes a null-ptr-deref in
reweight_entity() in CFS. The scenario is that the main process spawns
number of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),
wait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() gets
invoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()
for it.

In the above scenario there is a possibility that
setpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a thread
in the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and for
which the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet. This will
trigger a null pointer dereference in reweight_entity(), as it will
try to access the run queue pointer, which hasn't been set.

Before the mentioned change the cfs_rq pointer for the task  has been
set in sched_fork(), which is called much earlier in copy_process(),
before the new task is added to the thread_group.  Now it is done in
the sched_post_fork(), which is called after that.  To fix the issue
the remove the update_load param from the update_load param() function
and call reweight_task() only if the task flag doesn't have the
TASK_NEW flag set.

Fix this by adding mutex when calling link_group() or unlink_group(),
but parent configfs_subsystem is NULL when config_item is root.
So I create a mutex configfs_subsystem_mutex.

CVE-2022-48941
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix concurrent reset and removal of VFs

Commit c503e63200c6 ("ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown")
introduced a driver state flag, ICE_VF_DEINIT_IN_PROGRESS, which is
intended to prevent some issues with concurrently handling messages from
VFs while tearing down the VFs.

This change was motivated by crashes caused while tearing down and
bringing up VFs in rapid succession.

It turns out that the fix actually introduces issues with the VF driver
caused because the PF no longer responds to any messages sent by the VF
during its .remove routine. This results in the VF potentially removing
its DMA memory before the PF has shut down the device queues.

Additionally, the fix doesn't actually resolve concurrency issues within
the ice driver. It is possible for a VF to initiate a reset just prior
to the ice driver removing VFs. This can result in the remove task
concurrently operating while the VF is being reset. This results in
similar memory corruption and panics purportedly fixed by that commit.

Fix this concurrency at its root by protecting both the reset and
removal flows using the existing VF cfg_lock. This ensures that we
cannot remove the VF while any outstanding critical tasks such as a
virtchnl message or a reset are occurring.

This locking change also fixes the root cause originally fixed by commit
c503e63200c6 ("ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown"), so we
can simply revert it.

Note that I kept these two changes together because simply reverting the
original commit alone would leave the driver vulnerable to worse race
conditions.

CVE-2022-48989
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fscache: Fix oops due to race with cookie_lru and use_cookie

If a cookie expires from the LRU and the LRU_DISCARD flag is set, but
the state machine has not run yet, it's possible another thread can call
fscache_use_cookie and begin to use it.

When the cookie_worker finally runs, it will see the LRU_DISCARD flag
set, transition the cookie->state to LRU_DISCARDING, which will then
withdraw the cookie.  Once the cookie is withdrawn the object is removed
the below oops will occur because the object associated with the cookie
is now NULL.

Fix the oops by clearing the LRU_DISCARD bit if another thread uses the
cookie before the cookie_worker runs.

CVE-2022-49001
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: fix race when vmap stack overflow

Currently, when detecting vmap stack overflow, riscv firstly switches
to the so called shadow stack, then use this shadow stack to call the
get_overflow_stack() to get the overflow stack. However, there's
a race here if two or more harts use the same shadow stack at the same
time.

To solve this race, we introduce spin_shadow_stack atomic var, which
will be swap between its own address and 0 in atomic way, when the
var is set, it means the shadow_stack is being used; when the var
is cleared, it means the shadow_stack isn't being used.

[Palmer: Add AQ to the swap, and also some comments.]

	--- interrupt: 900 at plpar_hcall_norets_notrace+0x18/0x2c

The immediate cause of the crash is the access of tx_scrq in the following
snippet during a reset, where the tx_scrq can be either NULL or an address
that will soon be invalid:

	ibmvnic_xmit()
	{
		...
		tx_scrq = adapter->tx_scrq[queue_num];
		txq = netdev_get_tx_queue(netdev, queue_num);
		ind_bufp = &tx_scrq->ind_buf;

		if (test_bit(0, &adapter->resetting)) {
		...
	}

But beyond that, the call to ibmvnic_xmit() itself is not safe during a
reset and the reset path attempts to avoid this by stopping the queue in
ibmvnic_cleanup(). However just after the queue was stopped, an in-flight
ibmvnic_complete_tx() could have restarted the queue even as the reset is
progressing.

Since the queue was restarted we could get a call to ibmvnic_xmit() which
can then access the bad tx_scrq (or other fields).

We cannot however simply have ibmvnic_complete_tx() check the ->resetting
bit and skip starting the queue. This can race at the "back-end" of a good
reset which just restarted the queue but has not cleared the ->resetting
bit yet. If we skip restarting the queue due to ->resetting being true,
the queue would remain stopped indefinitely potentially leading to transmit
timeouts.

IOW ->resetting is too broad for this purpose. Instead use a new flag
that indicates whether or not the queues are active. Only the open/
reset paths control when the queues are active. ibmvnic_complete_tx()
and others wake up the queue only if the queue is marked active.

So we will have:
	A. reset/open thread in ibmvnic_cleanup() and __ibmvnic_open()

		->resetting = true
		->tx_queues_active = false
		disable tx queues
		...
		->tx_queues_active = true
		start tx queues

	B. Tx interrupt in ibmvnic_complete_tx():

		if (->tx_queues_active)
			netif_wake_subqueue();

To ensure that ->tx_queues_active and state of the queues are consistent,
we need a lock which:

	- must also be taken in the interrupt path (ibmvnic_complete_tx())
	- shared across the multiple

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xsk: Fix race at socket teardown

Fix a race in the xsk socket teardown code that can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference splat. The current xsk unbind code in xsk_unbind_dev() starts by
setting xs->state to XSK_UNBOUND, sets xs->dev to NULL and then waits for any
NAPI processing to terminate using synchronize_net(). After that, the release
code starts to tear down the socket state and free allocated memory.

There are two problems with the current code. First, setting xs->dev to NULL
before waiting for all users to stop using the socket is not correct. The
entry to the data plane functions xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), and xsk_recvmsg()
are all guarded by a test that xs->state is in the state XSK_BOUND and if not,
it returns right away. But one process might have passed this test but still
have not gotten to the point in which it uses xs->dev in the code. In this
interim, a second process executing xsk_unbind_dev() might have set xs->dev to
NULL which will lead to a crash for the first process. The solution here is
just to get rid of this NULL assignment since it is not used anymore. Before
commit 42fddcc7c64b ("xsk: use state member for socket synchronization"),
xs->dev was the gatekeeper to admit processes into the data plane functions,
but it was replaced with the state variable xs->state in the aforementioned
commit.

The second problem is that synchronize_net() does not wait for any process in
xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() to complete, which means that the
state they rely on might be cleaned up prematurely. This can happen when the
notifier gets called (at driver unload for example) as it uses xsk_unbind_dev().
Solve this by extending the RCU critical region from just the ndo_xsk_wakeup
to the whole functions mentioned above, so that both the test of xs->state ==
XSK_BOUND and the last use of any member of xs is covered by the RCU critical
section. This will guarantee that when synchronize_net() completes, there will
be no processes left executing xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() and
state can be cleaned up safely. Note that we need to drop the RCU lock for the
skb xmit path as it uses functions that might sleep. Due to this, we have to
retest the xs->state after we grab the mutex that protects the skb xmit code
from, among a number of things, an xsk_unbind_dev() being executed from the
notifier at the same time.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: fix race between nbd_alloc_config() and module removal

When nbd module is being removing, nbd_alloc_config() may be
called concurrently by nbd_genl_connect(), although try_module_get()
will return false, but nbd_alloc_config() doesn't handle it.

The race may lead to the leak of nbd_config and its related
resources (e.g, recv_workq) and oops in nbd_read_stat() due
to the unload of nbd module as shown below:

Fixing it by checking the return value of try_module_get()
in nbd_alloc_config(). As nbd_alloc_config() may return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV),
assign nbd->config only when nbd_alloc_config() succeeds to ensure
the value of nbd->config is binary (valid or NULL).

Also adding a debug message to check the reference counter
of nbd_config during module removal.

ext4_punch_hole(), remove similar handling from ext4_punch_hole().

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

list: fix a data-race around ep->rdllist

ep_poll() first calls ep_events_available() with no lock held and checks
if ep->rdllist is empty by list_empty_careful(), which reads
rdllist->prev.  Thus all accesses to it need some protection to avoid
store/load-tearing.

Note INIT_LIST_HEAD_RCU() already has the annotation for both prev
and next.

Commit bf3b9f6372c4 ("epoll: Add busy poll support to epoll with socket
fds.") added the first lockless ep_events_available(), and commit
c5a282e9635e ("fs/epoll: reduce the scope of wq lock in epoll_wait()")
made some ep_events_available() calls lockless and added single call under
a lock, finally commit e59d3c64cba6 ("epoll: eliminate unnecessary lock

CVE-2022-49607
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Fix data race between perf_event_set_output() and perf_mmap_close()

Yang Jihing reported a race between perf_event_set_output() and
perf_mmap_close():

	CPU1					CPU2

	perf_mmap_close(e2)
	  if (atomic_dec_and_test(&e2->rb->mmap_count)) // 1 - > 0
	    detach_rest = true

						ioctl(e1, IOC_SET_OUTPUT, e2)
						  perf_event_set_output(e1, e2)

	  ...
	  list_for_each_entry_rcu(e, &e2->rb->event_list, rb_entry)
	    ring_buffer_attach(e, NULL);
	    // e1 isn't yet added and
	    // therefore not detached

						    ring_buffer_attach(e1, e2->rb)
						      list_add_rcu(&e1->rb_entry,
								   &e2->rb->event_list)

After this; e1 is attached to an unmapped rb and a subsequent
perf_mmap() will loop forever more:

	again:
		mutex_lock(&e->mmap_mutex);
		if (event->rb) {
			...
			if (!atomic_inc_not_zero(&e->rb->mmap_count)) {
				...
				mutex_unlock(&e->mmap_mutex);
				goto again;
			}
		}

The loop in perf_mmap_close() holds e2->mmap_mutex, while the attach
in perf_event_set_output() holds e1->mmap_mutex. As such there is no
serialization to avoid this race.

Change perf_event_set_output() to take both e1->mmap_mutex and
e2->mmap_mutex to alleviate that problem. Additionally, have the loop
in perf_mmap() detach the rb directly, this avoids having to wait for
the concurrent perf_mmap_close() to get around to doing it to make
progress.

net: wwan: iosm: fix memory leak in ipc_wwan_dellink

IOSM driver registers network device without setting the
needs_free_netdev flag, and does NOT call free_netdev() when
unregisters network device, which causes a memory leak.

This patch sets needs_free_netdev to true when registers
network device, which makes netdev subsystem call free_netdev()
automatically after unregister_netdevice().

CVE-2022-49919
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: release flow rule object from commit path

No need to postpone this to the commit release path, since no packets
are walking over this object, this is accessed from control plane only.
This helped uncovered UAF triggered by races with the netlink notifier.

CVE-2022-49920
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: netlink notifier might race to release objects

commit release path is invoked via call_rcu and it runs lockless to
release the objects after rcu grace period. The netlink notifier handler
might win race to remove objects that the transaction context is still
referencing from the commit release path.

Call rcu_barrier() to ensure pending rcu callbacks run to completion
if the list of transactions to be destroyed is not empty.
