CVE-2024-21601

A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability in the Flow-processing Daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (Dos).

On SRX Series devices when two different threads try to simultaneously process a queue which is used for TCP events flowd will crash. One of these threads can not be triggered externally, so the exploitation of this race condition is outside the attackers direct control.

Continued exploitation of this issue will lead to a sustained DoS.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:



  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S5;
  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;
  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4;
  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S3;
  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S1;
  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3;
  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-S1, 22.4R3.

CVE-2024-23331
Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The Vite dev server option `server.fs.deny` can be bypassed on case-insensitive file systems using case-augmented versions of filenames. Notably this affects servers hosted on Windows. This bypass is similar to CVE-2023-34092 -- with surface area reduced to hosts having case-insensitive filesystems. Since `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive glob matching, but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing, the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files. This issue has been addressed in vite@5.0.12, vite@4.5.2, vite@3.2.8, and vite@2.9.17. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to dev servers.

This is potentially unwanted, e.g., because there is no public documentation of security measures for the private key, and arbitrary software could be signed if the private key were to be compromised. NOTE: the vendor's position is "we do not have EV cert, so we use test cert as a workaround." Insertion into Trusted Root Certification Authorities was the originally intended behavior, and the UI ensured that the certificate installation step (checked by default) was visible to the user before proceeding with the product installation.

Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way
we can depend solely on the atomic ref counter for
synchronization.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: fix IO hang from sbitmap wakeup race

In blk_mq_mark_tag_wait(), __add_wait_queue() may be re-ordered
with the following blk_mq_get_driver_tag() in case of getting driver
tag failure.

Then in __sbitmap_queue_wake_up(), waitqueue_active() may not observe
the added waiter in blk_mq_mark_tag_wait() and wake up nothing, meantime
blk_mq_mark_tag_wait() can't get driver tag successfully.

This issue can be reproduced by running the following test in loop, and
fio hang can be observed in < 30min when running it on my test VM
in laptop.

	modprobe -r scsi_debug
	modprobe scsi_debug delay=0 dev_size_mb=4096 max_queue=1 host_max_queue=1 submit_queues=4
	dev=`ls -d /sys/bus/pseudo/drivers/scsi_debug/adapter*/host*/target*/*/block/* | head -1 | xargs basename`

       		--runtime=100 --numjobs=40 --time_based --name=test \

Fix the issue by adding one explicit barrier in blk_mq_mark_tag_wait(), which
is just fine in case of running out of tag.

CVE-2024-26698
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove

In commit ac5047671758 ("hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the
VMBus channel"), napi_disable was getting called for all channels,
including all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.

This caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe()
has finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet.
netvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the
sub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running.
netvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which
netvsc_subchan_work did not run.

netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI
cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the
NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the
opposite.

Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those
subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.

This fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not
getting called for non-enabled NAPI struct.
But netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct
for cleanup purpose.

CVE-2024-26794
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix race between ordered extent completion and fiemap

For fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for the
whole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a
scenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of
the same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but
it may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).

However by not locking the target extent range for the whole duration of
the fiemap call we can race with an ordered extent. This happens like
this:

1) The fiemap task finishes processing a file extent item that covers
   the file range [512K, 1M[, and that file extent item is the last item
   in the leaf currently being processed;

2) And ordered extent for the file range [768K, 2M[, in COW mode,
   completes (btrfs_finish_one_ordered()) and the file extent item
   covering the range [512K, 1M[ is trimmed to cover the range
   [512K, 768K[ and then a new file extent item for the range [768K, 2M[
   is inserted in the inode's subvolume tree;

3) The fiemap task calls fiemap_next_leaf_item(), which then calls
   btrfs_next_leaf() to find the next leaf / item. This finds that the
   the next key following the one we previously processed (its type is
   BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and its offset is 512K), is the key corresponding
   to the new file extent item inserted by the ordered extent, which has
   a type of BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and an offset of 768K;

4) Later the fiemap code ends up at emit_fiemap_extent() and triggers
   the warning:

      if (cache->offset + cache->len > offset) {
               WARN_ON(1);
               return -EINVAL;
      }

   Since we get 1M > 768K, because the previously emitted entry for the
   old extent covering the file range [512K, 1M[ ends at an offset that
   is greater than the new extent's start offset (768K). This makes fiemap
   fail with -EINVAL besides triggering the warning that produces a stack
   trace like the following:

CVE-2024-26810
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/pci: Lock external INTx masking ops

Mask operations through config space changes to DisINTx may race INTx
configuration changes via ioctl.  Create wrappers that add locking for
paths outside of the core interrupt code.

In particular, irq_type is updated holding igate, therefore testing
is_intx() requires holding igate.  For example clearing DisINTx from
config space can otherwise race changes of the interrupt configuration.

This aligns interfaces which may trigger the INTx eventfd into two
camps, one side serialized by igate and the other only enabled while
INTx is configured.  A subsequent patch introduces synchronization for
the latter flows.

CVE-2024-26837
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: switchdev: Skip MDB replays of deferred events on offload

Before this change, generation of the list of MDB events to replay
would race against the creation of new group memberships, either from
the IGMP/MLD snooping logic or from user configuration.

While new memberships are immediately visible to walkers of
br->mdb_list, the notification of their existence to switchdev event
subscribers is deferred until a later point in time. So if a replay
list was generated during a time that overlapped with such a window,
it would also contain a replay of the not-yet-delivered event.

The driver would thus receive two copies of what the bridge internally
considered to be one single event. On destruction of the bridge, only
a single membership deletion event was therefore sent. As a
consequence of this, drivers which reference count memberships (at
least DSA), would be left with orphan groups in their hardware
database when the bridge was destroyed.

This is only an issue when replaying additions. While deletion events
may still be pending on the deferred queue, they will already have
been removed from br->mdb_list, so no duplicates can be generated in
that scenario.

To a user this meant that old group memberships, from a bridge in
which a port was previously attached, could be reanimated (in
hardware) when the port joined a new bridge, without the new bridge's
knowledge.

For example, on an mv88e6xxx system, create a snooping bridge and
immediately add a port to it:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br0 up type bridge mcast_snooping 1 && \
    > ip link set dev x3 up master br0

And then destroy the bridge:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link del dev br0
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ mvls atu
    ADDRESS             FID  STATE      Q  F  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    DEV:0 Marvell 88E6393X
    33:33:00:00:00:6a     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    33:33:ff:87:e4:3f     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     1  static     -  -  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$

The two IPv6 groups remain in the hardware database because the
port (x3) is notified of the host's membership twice: once via the
original event and once via a replay. Since only a single delete
notification is sent, the count remains at 1 when the bridge is
destroyed.

Then add the same port (or another port belonging to the same hardware
domain) to a new bridge, this time with snooping disabled:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br1 up type bridge mcast_snooping 0 && \
    > ip link set dev x3 up master br1

All multicast, including the two IPv6 groups from br0, should now be
flooded, according to the policy of br1. But instead the old
memberships are still active in the hardware database, causing the
switch to only forward traffic to those groups towards the CPU (port
0).

Eliminate the race in two steps:

1. Grab the write-side lock of the MDB while generating the replay
   list.

This prevents new memberships from showing up while we are generating
the replay list. But it leaves the scenario in which a deferred event
was already generated, but not delivered, before we grabbed the
lock. Therefore:

2. Make sure that no deferred version of a replay event is already
   enqueued to the switchdev deferred queue, before adding it to the
   replay list, when replaying additions.

CVE-2024-26869
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to truncate meta inode pages forcely

Below race case can cause data corruption:

Thread A				GC thread
					- gc_data_segment
					 - ra_data_block
					  - locked meta_inode page
- f2fs_inplace_write_data
 - invalidate_mapping_pages

 : write last dirty data to old blkaddr
					 - move_data_block
					  - load old data from meta_inode page
					  - f2fs_submit_page_write
					  : write old data to new blkaddr

Because invalidate_mapping_pages() will skip invalidating page which
has unclear status including locked, dirty, writeback and so on, so
we need to use truncate_inode_pages_range() instead of
invalidate_mapping_pages() to make sure meta_inode page will be dropped.

Below race may cause NULL pointer dereference

P1					P2

If dquot_free_inode(or other routines) checks inode's quota pointers (1)
before quota_off sets it to NULL(2) and use it (3) after that, NULL pointer
dereference will be triggered.

So let's fix it by using a temporary pointer to avoid this issue.

netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation

The patch "netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy
and kernel side add/del/test", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition.
But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows
it down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.

Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as
rcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors
which need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy
functions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at
executing the command received by netlink and moving the remaining
part only into the rcu callback.

CVE-2024-27005
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

interconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulated

The icc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lock
mutexes in [1] to avoid lockdep splats. However, this didn't adequately
protect access to icc_node::req_list.

The icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterate over req_list while
only holding icc_bw_lock, but req_list can be modified while only
holding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw(), of_icc_get(),
and icc_put().

Example A:

  CPU0                               CPU1
  ----                               ----
  icc_set_bw(path_a)
    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);
                                     icc_put(path_b)
                                       mutex_lock(&icc_lock);
    aggregate_requests()
      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...
                                       hlist_del(...
        <r = invalid pointer>

Example B:

  CPU0                               CPU1
  ----                               ----
  icc_set_bw(path_a)
    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);
                                     path_b = of_icc_get()
                                       of_icc_get_by_index()
                                         mutex_lock(&icc_lock);
                                         path_find()
                                           path_init()
    aggregate_requests()
      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...
                                             hlist_add_head(...
        <r = invalid pointer>

Fix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulating
icc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don't
perform any memory allocations, so we should still be safe from the
original lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.

CVE-2024-35977
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition

The cros_ec_uart_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open() before
it calls serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This can trigger a NULL pointer
dereference:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
    ...
    Call Trace:
     <TASK>
     ...
     ? ttyport_receive_buf

A simplified version of crashing code is as follows:

    static inline size_t serdev_controller_receive_buf(struct serdev_controller *ctrl,
                                                      const u8 *data,
                                                      size_t count)
    {
            struct serdev_device *serdev = ctrl->serdev;

            if (!serdev || !serdev->ops->receive_buf) // CRASH!
                return 0;

            return serdev->ops->receive_buf(serdev, data, count);
    }

It assumes that if SERPORT_ACTIVE is set and serdev exists, serdev->ops
will also exist. This conflicts with the existing cros_ec_uart_probe()
logic, as it first calls devm_serdev_device_open() (which sets
SERPORT_ACTIVE), and only later sets serdev->ops via
serdev_device_set_client_ops().

Commit 01f95d42b8f4 ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: fix race
condition") attempted to fix a similar race condition, but while doing
so, made the window of error for this race condition to happen much
wider.

Attempt to fix the race condition again, making sure we fully setup
before calling devm_serdev_device_open().

CVE-2024-36899
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration
of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.

CVE-2024-36927
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4: Fix uninit-value access in __ip_make_skb()

KMSAN reported uninit-value access in __ip_make_skb() [1].  __ip_make_skb()
tests HDRINCL to know if the skb has icmphdr. However, HDRINCL can cause a
race condition. If calling setsockopt(2) with IP_HDRINCL changes HDRINCL
while __ip_make_skb() is running, the function will access icmphdr in the
skb even if it is not included. This causes the issue reported by KMSAN.

Check FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH on fl4->flowi4_flags instead of testing HDRINCL
on the socket.

Also, fl4->fl4_icmp_type and fl4->fl4_icmp_code are not initialized. These
are union in struct flowi4 and are implicitly initialized by
flowi4_init_output(), but we should not rely on specific union layout.

Initialize these explicitly in raw_sendmsg().

CVE-2024-39554
A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.


This issue affects:

A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Pinot.

This issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue.

Details: 

When using a request to path “/appconfigs” to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the  Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.

The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. Because of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above. This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.).

CVE-2024-40975
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Unregister devices in reverse order

Not all subsystems support a device getting removed while there are
still consumers of the device with a reference to the device.

One example of this is the regulator subsystem. If a regulator gets
unregistered while there are still drivers holding a reference
a WARN() at drivers/regulator/core.c:5829 triggers, e.g.:

 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1587 at drivers/regulator/core.c:5829 regulator_unregister
 Hardware name: Intel Corp. VALLEYVIEW C0 PLATFORM/BYT-T FFD8, BIOS BLADE_21.X64.0005.R00.1504101516 FFD8_X64_R_2015_04_10_1516 04/10/2015

  devres_release_group

  x86_android_tablet_remove

On the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 series the bq24190 charger chip also provides
a 5V boost converter output for powering USB devices connected to the micro
USB port, the bq24190-charger driver exports this as a Vbus regulator.

On the 830 (8") and 1050 ("10") models this regulator is controlled by
a platform_device and x86_android_tablet_remove() removes platform_device-s
before i2c_clients so the consumer gets removed first.

But on the 1380 (13") model there is a lc824206xa micro-USB switch
connected over I2C and the extcon driver for that controls the regulator.
The bq24190 i2c-client *must* be registered first, because that creates
the regulator with the lc824206xa listed as its consumer. If the regulator
has not been registered yet the lc824206xa driver will end up getting
a dummy regulator.

Since in this case both the regulator provider and consumer are I2C
devices, the only way to ensure that the consumer is unregistered first
is to unregister the I2C devices in reverse order of in which they were
created.

For consistency and to avoid similar problems in the future change
x86_android_tablet_remove() to unregister all device types in reverse
order.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix leak of blob encryption key

Trusted keys unseal the key blob on load, but keep the sealed payload in
the blob field so that every subsequent read (export) will simply
convert this field to hex and send it to userspace.

With DCP-based trusted keys, we decrypt the blob encryption key (BEK)
in the Kernel due hardware limitations and then decrypt the blob payload.
BEK decryption is done in-place which means that the trusted key blob
field is modified and it consequently holds the BEK in plain text.
Every subsequent read of that key thus send the plain text BEK instead
of the encrypted BEK to userspace.

This issue only occurs when importing a trusted DCP-based key and
then exporting it again. This should rarely happen as the common use cases
are to either create a new trusted key and export it, or import a key
blob and then just use it without exporting it again.

Fix this by performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated
buffer. Further always wipe the plain text BEK buffer to prevent leaking
the key via uninitialized memory.

CVE-2024-45159
An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.x before 3.6.1. With TLS 1.3, when a server enables optional authentication of the client, if the client-provided certificate does not have appropriate values in if keyUsage or extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value of mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have the MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE bits clear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses other than TLS client authentication would nonetheless be able to use it for TLS client authentication. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only with optional authentication (with required authentication, the handshake would be aborted with a fatal alert).

alf.io is an open source ticket reservation system for conferences, trade shows, workshops, and meetups. Prior to version 2.0-M5, a race condition allows the user to bypass the limit on the number of promo codes and use the discount coupon multiple times. In "alf.io", an event organizer can apply price discounts by using promo codes to your events. The organizer can limit the number of promo codes that will be used for this, but the time-gap between checking the number of codes and restricting the use of the codes allows a threat actor to bypass the promo code limit. Version 2.0-M5 fixes this issue.

CVE-2024-46870
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35

[Why]
DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.

Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race
condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,
leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register
accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined
state.

[How]
We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but
for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race
condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the
risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog
timeout are minimal.

CVE-2024-47660
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily

In some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries.
Hence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take a
significant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happens
under inode->i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lock
when we remove the watch from the directory as the
__fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask()
races with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from
__fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockup
reports reported by users.

Fix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() to
set PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children.

When parent stops watching children, clear false positive PARENT_WATCHED
flags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child.

vfs: fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput()

Hi, all

Recently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it into
and I believe it'a race in vfs.

Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is
called by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread calling
generic_shutdown_super().

cpu0:                              cpu1:
iput() // i_count is 1
  ->spin_lock(inode)
  ->dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()
    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()
      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue;
      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check
      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out
   ->spin_unlock()
// note here: the inode 261
// was still at sb list and hash list,
// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set

btrfs_iget()
  // after some function calls
  ->find_inode()
    // found the above inode 261
    ->spin_lock(inode)
   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE
   // and passed
      ->__iget()
    ->spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back
                                        ->spin_lock(inode)
                                        // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,
                                        // passed and set I_FREEING
iput()                                  ->spin_unlock(inode)
  ->spin_lock(inode)			  ->evict()
  // dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()
    ->spin_unlock()
    ->evict()

Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting
the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)
statement both within clear_inode() and iput().

To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.
Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and
the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.

If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.

As Christian Brauner pointed out [1]: the root cause is f2fs sets
SB_RDONLY flag in internal function, rather than setting the flag
covered w/ sb->s_umount semaphore via remount procedure, then below
race condition causes this bug:

- freeze_super()
 - sb_wait_write(sb, SB_FREEZE_WRITE)
 - sb_wait_write(sb, SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT)
 - sb_wait_write(sb, SB_FREEZE_FS)
					- f2fs_handle_critical_error
					 - sb->s_flags |= SB_RDONLY
- thaw_super
 - thaw_super_locked
  - sb_rdonly() is true, so it skips
    sb_freeze_unlock(sb, SB_FREEZE_FS)
  - deactivate_locked_super

Since f2fs has almost the same logic as ext4 [2] when handling critical
error in filesystem if it mounts w/ errors=remount-ro option:
- set CP_ERROR_FLAG flag which indicates filesystem is stopped
- record errors to superblock
- set SB_RDONLY falg
Once we set CP_ERROR_FLAG flag, all writable interfaces can detect the
flag and stop any further updates on filesystem. So, it is safe to not
set SB_RDONLY flag, let's remove the logic and keep in line w/ ext4 [3].

CVE-2024-47741
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix race setting file private on concurrent lseek using same fd

When doing concurrent lseek(2) system calls against the same file
descriptor, using multiple threads belonging to the same process, we have
a short time window where a race happens and can result in a memory leak.

The race happens like this:

1) A program opens a file descriptor for a file and then spawns two
   threads (with the pthreads library for example), lets call them
   task A and task B;

2) Task A calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE and ends up at
   file.c:find_desired_extent() while holding a read lock on the inode;

3) At the start of find_desired_extent(), it extracts the file's
   private_data pointer into a local variable named 'private', which has
   a value of NULL;

4) Task B also calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE, locks the inode
   in shared mode and enters file.c:find_desired_extent(), where it also
   extracts file->private_data into its local variable 'private', which
   has a NULL value;

5) Because it saw a NULL file private, task A allocates a private
   structure and assigns to the file structure;

6) Task B also saw a NULL file private so it also allocates its own file
   private and then assigns it to the same file structure, since both
   tasks are using the same file descriptor.

   At this point we leak the private structure allocated by task A.

Besides the memory leak, there's also the detail that both tasks end up
using the same cached state record in the private structure (struct
btrfs_file_private::llseek_cached_state), which can result in a
use-after-free problem since one task can free it while the other is
still using it (only one task took a reference count on it). Also, sharing
the cached state is not a good idea since it could result in incorrect
results in the future - right now it should not be a problem because it
end ups being used only in extent-io-tree.c:count_range_bits() where we do
range validation before using the cached state.

Fix this by protecting the private assignment and check of a file while
holding the inode's spinlock and keep track of the task that allocated
the private, so that it's used only by that task in order to prevent
user-after-free issues with the cached state record as well as potentially
using it incorrectly in the future.

CVE-2024-49769
Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.

rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation

In rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O
thread that will handle it.  This is a problem, however, as there's a gap
between the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv()
from the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O
thread.

As a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's
no I/O thread yet.

A better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such
that the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.

After tracing the scheduling event, it was discovered that the migration
of the "timerlat/1" thread was performed during thread creation. Further
analysis confirmed that it is because the CPU online processing for
osnoise is implemented through workers, which is asynchronous with the
offline processing. When the worker was scheduled to create a thread, the
CPU may has already been removed from the cpu_online_mask during the offline
process, resulting in the inability to select the right CPU:

T1                       | T2
[CPUHP_ONLINE]           | cpu_device_down()

    cpus_read_lock()     |
    start_kthread(1)     |
    cpus_read_unlock()   |

To fix this, skip online processing if the CPU is already offline.

ACPI: battery: Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hook

When a battery hook returns an error when adding a new battery, then
the battery hook is automatically unregistered.
However the battery hook provider cannot know that, so it will later
call battery_hook_unregister() on the already unregistered battery
hook, resulting in a crash.

Fix this by using the list head to mark already unregistered battery
hooks as already being unregistered so that they can be ignored by
battery_hook_unregister().

CVE-2024-50066
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/mremap: fix move_normal_pmd/retract_page_tables race

In mremap(), move_page_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the
specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of
page table entries should be moved.

At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are
held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered
by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called,
which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd(). 
move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and
destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the
destination.

The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page
table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken
after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it. 
So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the
same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note
that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it
through the file rmap:

                                             retract_page_tables
                                               i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)
                                               pmdp_collapse_flush
                                               i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)
        move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)
          take_rmap_locks
          move_normal_pmd
          drop_rmap_locks

When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries
in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect
depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end
up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely
exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.

Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a
page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and
let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then
bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.

Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create
shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't
zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config
flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need
shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally
requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags,
which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't
know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like
that.

Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege
escalation when it is reachable.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device

iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason
seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before
interrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume
trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

interrupts get enabled during resume.

CVE-2024-50338
Git Credential Manager (GCM) is a secure Git credential helper built on .NET that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The Git credential protocol is text-based over standard input/output, and consists of a series of lines of key-value pairs in the format `key=value`. Git's documentation restricts the use of the NUL (`\0`) character and newlines to form part of the keys or values. When Git reads from standard input, it considers both LF and CRLF as newline characters for the credential protocol by virtue of calling `strbuf_getline` that calls to `strbuf_getdelim_strip_crlf`. Git also validates that a newline is not present in the value by checking for the presence of the line-feed character (LF, `\n`), and errors if this is the case. This captures both LF and CRLF-type newlines. Git Credential Manager uses the .NET standard library `StreamReader` class to read the standard input stream line-by-line and parse the `key=value` credential protocol format. The implementation of the `ReadLineAsync` method considers LF, CRLF, and CR as valid line endings. This is means that .NET considers a single CR as a valid newline character, whereas Git does not. This mismatch of newline treatment between Git and GCM means that an attacker can craft a malicious remote URL. When a user clones or otherwise interacts with a malicious repository that requires authentication, the attacker can capture credentials for another Git remote. The attack is also heightened when cloning from repositories with submodules when using the `--recursive` clone option as the user is not able to inspect the submodule remote URLs beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only interact with trusted remote repositories, and not clone with `--recursive` to allow inspection of any submodule URLs before cloning those submodules.

CVE-2024-52008
Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as short as a single character. When an email messaging provider is enabled and a new user account is created in the system, an invite email containing a special link is sent to the new user's email address. This link directs the new user to a page where they can set their initial password. While the user interface implements password complexity checks, these validations are only performed client-side. The underlying `/api/v1/user/accept-invite` API endpoint does not implement the same password policy validations. This vulnerability allows an invited user to set an extremely weak password for their own account during the initial account setup process. Therefore that specific user's account can be compromised easily by an attacker guessing or brute forcing the password. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.50.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-53088
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.

CVE-2024-53121
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: fs, lock FTE when checking if active

The referenced commits introduced a two-step process for deleting FTEs:

- Lock the FTE, delete it from hardware, set the hardware deletion function
  to NULL and unlock the FTE.
- Lock the parent flow group, delete the software copy of the FTE, and
  remove it from the xarray.

However, this approach encounters a race condition if a rule with the same
match value is added simultaneously. In this scenario, fs_core may set the
hardware deletion function to NULL prematurely, causing a panic during
subsequent rule deletions.

To prevent this, ensure the active flag of the FTE is checked under a lock,
which will prevent the fs_core layer from attaching a new steering rule to
an FTE that is in the process of deletion.

Additional active subflows - i.e. created by the in kernel path
manager - are included into the subflow list before starting the
3whs.

A racing recvmsg() spooling data received on an already established
subflow would unconditionally call tcp_cleanup_rbuf() on all the
current subflows, potentially hitting a divide by zero error on
the newly created ones.

Explicitly check that the subflow is in a suitable state before
invoking tcp_cleanup_rbuf().

The root cause is the current bad handling of racing disconnect.
After the blamed commit below, sk_wait_data() can return (with
error) with the underlying socket disconnected and a zero rcv_mss.

Catch the error and return without performing any additional

Its possible that two threads call tcp_v6_do_rcv()/sk_forward_alloc_add()
concurrently when sk->sk_state == TCP_LISTEN with sk->sk_lock unlocked,
which triggers a data-race around sk->sk_forward_alloc:
tcp_v6_rcv
    tcp_v6_do_rcv
        skb_clone_and_charge_r
            sk_rmem_schedule
                __sk_mem_schedule
                    sk_forward_alloc_add()
            skb_set_owner_r
                sk_mem_charge
                    sk_forward_alloc_add()
        __kfree_skb
            skb_release_all
                skb_release_head_state
                    sock_rfree
                        sk_mem_uncharge
                            sk_forward_alloc_add()
                            sk_mem_reclaim
                                // set local var reclaimable
                                __sk_mem_reclaim
                                    sk_forward_alloc_add()

In this syzkaller testcase, two threads call
tcp_v6_do_rcv() with skb->truesize=768, the sk_forward_alloc changes like
this:
 (cpu 1)             | (cpu 2)             | sk_forward_alloc
 ...                 | ...                 | 0
 __sk_mem_schedule() |                     | +4096 = 4096
                     | __sk_mem_schedule() | +4096 = 8192
 sk_mem_charge()     |                     | -768  = 7424
                     | sk_mem_charge()     | -768  = 6656
 ...                 |    ...              |
 sk_mem_uncharge()   |                     | +768  = 7424
 reclaimable=7424    |                     |
                     | sk_mem_uncharge()   | +768  = 8192
                     | reclaimable=8192    |
 __sk_mem_reclaim()  |                     | -4096 = 4096
                     | __sk_mem_reclaim()  | -8192 = -4096 != 0

The skb_clone_and_charge_r() should not be called in tcp_v6_do_rcv() when
sk->sk_state is TCP_LISTEN, it happens later in tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock().
Fix the same issue in dccp_v6_do_rcv().

CVE-2024-53186
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling

A race condition exists between SMB request handling in
`ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` and the freeing of `ksmbd_conn` in the
workqueue handler `handle_ksmbd_work()`. This leads to a UAF.
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked

This race condition arises as follows:
- `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:
  `wait_event(conn->r_count_q, atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);`
- Meanwhile, `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using
  `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)`, and if it reaches zero, calls
  `ksmbd_conn_free()`, which frees `conn`.
- However, after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`,
  it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:
  `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`
  This results in a UAF, as `conn` has already been freed.

The discovery of this UAF can be referenced in the following PR for
syzkaller's support for SMB requests.

CVE-2024-54134
A publish-access account was compromised for `@solana/web3.js`, a JavaScript library that is commonly used by Solana dapps. This allowed an attacker to publish unauthorized and malicious packages that were modified, allowing them to steal private key material and drain funds from dapps, like bots, that handle private keys directly. This issue should not affect non-custodial wallets, as they generally do not expose private keys during transactions. This is not an issue with the Solana protocol itself, but with a specific JavaScript client library and only appears to affect projects that directly handle private keys and that updated within the window of 3:20pm UTC and 8:25pm UTC on Tuesday, December 3, 2024. These two unauthorized versions (1.95.6 and 1.95.7) were caught within hours and have since been unpublished. All Solana app developers should upgrade to version 1.95.8. Developers that suspect they might be compromised should rotate any suspect authority keys, including multisigs, program authorities, server keypairs, and so on.

CVE-2024-56540
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Prevent recovery invocation during probe and resume

Refactor IPC send and receive functions to allow correct
handling of operations that should not trigger a recovery process.

Expose ivpu_send_receive_internal(), which is now utilized by the D0i3
entry, DCT initialization, and HWS initialization functions.
These functions have been modified to return error codes gracefully,
rather than initiating recovery.

The updated functions are invoked within ivpu_probe() and ivpu_resume(),
ensuring that any errors encountered during these stages result in a proper
teardown or shutdown sequence. The previous approach of triggering recovery
within these functions could lead to a race condition, potentially causing
undefined behavior and kernel crashes due to null pointer dereferences.

CVE-2024-56568
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

Fix __sock_map_delete(), do not allow sock_map_unref() on elements that
may have been replaced.

CVE-2024-56674
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_net: correct netdev_tx_reset_queue() invocation point

When virtnet_close is followed by virtnet_open, some TX completions can
possibly remain unconsumed, until they are finally processed during the
first NAPI poll after the netdev_tx_reset_queue(), resulting in a crash
[1]. Commit b96ed2c97c79 ("virtio_net: move netdev_tx_reset_queue() call
before RX napi enable") was not sufficient to eliminate all BQL crash
cases for virtio-net.

This issue can be reproduced with the latest net-next master by running:
`while :; do ip l set DEV down; ip l set DEV up; done` under heavy network
TX load from inside the machine.

netdev_tx_reset_queue() can actually be dropped from virtnet_open path;
the device is not stopped in any case. For BQL core part, it's just like
traffic nearly ceases to exist for some period. For stall detector added
to BQL, even if virtnet_close could somehow lead to some TX completions
delayed for long, followed by virtnet_open, we can just take it as stall
as mentioned in commit 6025b9135f7a ("net: dqs: add NIC stall detector
based on BQL"). Note also that users can still reset stall_max via sysfs.

So, drop netdev_tx_reset_queue() from virtnet_enable_queue_pair(). This
eliminates the BQL crashes. As a result, netdev_tx_reset_queue() is now
explicitly required in freeze/restore path. This patch adds it to
immediately after free_unused_bufs(), following the rule of thumb:
netdev_tx_reset_queue() should follow any SKB freeing not followed by
netdev_tx_completed_queue(). This seems the most consistent and
streamlined approach, and now netdev_tx_reset_queue() runs whenever
free_unused_bufs() is done.

CVE-2024-57913
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: f_fs: Remove WARN_ON in functionfs_bind

This commit addresses an issue related to below kernel panic where
panic_on_warn is enabled. It is caused by the unnecessary use of WARN_ON
in functionsfs_bind, which easily leads to the following scenarios.

1.adb_write in adbd               2. UDC write via configfs

->StartMonitor()                       ->bus_add_driver()
 ->adb_read()                           ->gadget_bind_driver()

                                       <ffs->state !=FFS_ACTIVE>

The adb_open, adb_read, and adb_write operations are invoked from the
daemon, but trying to bind the function is a process that is invoked by
UDC write through configfs, which opens up the possibility of a race
condition between the two paths. In this race scenario, the kernel panic
occurs due to the WARN_ON from functionfs_bind when panic_on_warn is
enabled. This commit fixes the kernel panic by removing the unnecessary
WARN_ON.

A signal handler in sshd(8) may call a logging function that is not async-signal-safe.  The signal handler is invoked when a client does not authenticate within the LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default).  This signal handler executes in the context of the sshd(8)'s privileged code, which is not sandboxed and runs with full root privileges.

This issue is another instance of the problem in CVE-2024-6387 addressed by FreeBSD-SA-24:04.openssh.  The faulty code in this case is from the integration of blacklistd in OpenSSH in FreeBSD.

As a result of calling functions that are not async-signal-safe in the privileged sshd(8) context, a race condition exists that a determined attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote code execution as root.
